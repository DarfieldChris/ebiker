Display replacement for Bafang mid-drive motor controller.
DIY Bluetooth communication module to replace the display provided with my  [Bafang BBSHD motor kit](https://goldenmotor.bike/product/bafang-bbshd-48-volt-1000-watt-68mmm-mid-drive-kit/).
The goal is to use my phone as the display for my ebike instead. I know there are already a number of options out there but I started this as a bit of a learning exercise.
## Hardware
- [Adafruit Feather M0](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-bluefruit-le)
- [Bafang female end of display cable](https://lunacycle.com/bafang-display-extension-cable/)
## Software
- I am using react-native on the phone and c++ (Arduino IDE) on the feather.
